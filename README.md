# Bulldozer of love

This is an Alexa skill that asks the user their name and tells them that their mom and dad love them. It was created with the author's son and friend's daughter in mind, but it works for any name. It is bulldozer themed, after a silly nickname I was once given by a high school English teacher that became something of a meme among my friends. 

The invocation name is "nate koser the bulldozer". Try getting started with "Alexa, start nate koser the bulldozer". This starts a dialogue where Alexa compliments the user's name, asks if they can say, "Hi, bulldozer" and then tells them that their mom and dad love them. 

The accompanying javascript file gives the Lambda function for the backend that can be linked to the skill.
